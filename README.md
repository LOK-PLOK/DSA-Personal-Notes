### Confirmed Information:

## Pre-midterm Topics:
- ADT List
- ADT Stack
- ADT Queue

## Mentioned types of Data Structure Implementation 
- Array
- Linked List
- Cursor-based (need to learn more)

### ADT List
- a data structure that represents an ordered collection of elements.
- Known List operations include: insert,delete,member,traverse, and etc.
- Implementations:
	1. **Array Implementation(4 versions)**
		- **Version 1**: List is a structure containing an array and variable count, where count represents the actual number of elements in the array
		- **Version 2**: List is a pointer to a structure that contains an array and the variable count
		- **Version 3**: List is a structure containing a pointer variable that points to the beginning address of a dynamic array, and variable count.
		- **Version 4**: List is a pointer to a structure that contains a pointer variable that points to the beginning address of a dynamic array, and variable count.
		- **NOTE**: in representing the total number of elements in ADT List it could be:
			- **Count**: which represent the total number of elements.
			- **Last Index**: which represents that index of the last inserted element in a List.
	2. **Linked List Implementation**
		- Singly Linked List (**focus**)
	3. **Cursor-based Implementation**

### ADT Stack 
- A linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out** (*LIFO*) principle. This means that the last element to be inserted in a stack is to be removed first.
- Operations: Top/Peek, Push, Pop, IsEmpty, isFull, and initialize
- Implementations
	1. **Array Implementations** (with in mind the 4 possible versions)
	2. **Linked List Implementation**
	3. **Cursor-based Implementation**

### ADT Queue
- A linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out** (*FIFO*) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
- Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, isEmpty, isFull and initialize
- Implementations
	1.  **Array Implementation:**
	2. **Linked List Implementation:**

### IMPORTANT
- Stacks and Queue data structures cannot be traversed based from the given definitions
